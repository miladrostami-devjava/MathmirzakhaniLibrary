## Description Library Math:

This is a mathematics library. In this library,
I am trying to implement and code all the calculations and 
algorithms of mathematics in two categories: basic and advanced. 
This library will be constantly updated and 
we will see the challenges of converting mathematics into programming. 
In other words, we intend to implement mathematics with 
the Java programming language.

###  description :
A comprehensive mathematics library for Java, divided into two main packages:
- **Basic**: Contains foundational mathematical topics.
- **Advanced**: Includes advanced mathematical concepts and techniques.
